# BootStrap Cheatsheet
Following this exercise has really helped me strengthen my grip on Bootstrap class usage.

While learning the different components of bootstrap, I also managed to pick up using Emmet.  
Emmet is basically a plugin which allows you to quickly declare the html tags to the way you want it.  
Want to create a unordered list with 6 list item and they all share a class and don't want to waste time typing it out? Emmet does it for you! you just have to remember the short cut keys.  

It's very simple. 
`ul>li.grocery-list*6>` and voila, you have it! It may look intimidating at first, but trust me, it's worth picking it up! My life has gotten so much better after learning so much.
